# BUGS
To test it in different devices i started using the console toggle device toolbar, when I fixed all the versions for the different tablets and mobile screens I opened the website  from my Iphone and realised the display was not looking as it should.
To fix this I created a specific and new mobile version. For this purpose i downloaded Xcode simulator and served the website via [npm package serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to be able to access it instantly and remotely through my own phone.
